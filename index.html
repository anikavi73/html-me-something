       <h1> Angkor Wat</h1>
       
       <main>Angkor Wat is a temple complex in Cambodia and is the largest religious monument in the world,
           on a site measuring 162.6 hectares (1,626,000 m2; 402 acres). It was originally constructed as a Hindu temple
           dedicated to the god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire, it was gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple towards 
           the end of the 12th century. It was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century in 
           Ya≈õodharapura, the capital of the Khmer Empire, as his state temple and eventual mausoleum. </main>

        <p>Breaking from the Shaiva tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was instead dedicated to Vishnu. As the best-preserved 
           temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation. The temple
           is at the top of the high classical style of Khmer architecture. It has become a symbol of Cambodia, appearing on its 
           national flag, and it is the country's prime attraction for visitors. </p>

        <article>Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the temple-mountain and the later galleried temple.
           It is designed to represent Mount Meru, home of the devas in Hindu mythology: within a moat more than 5 kilometres 
           (3 mi) long[7] and an outer wall 3.6 kilometres (2.2 mi) long are three rectangular galleries, each raised above the
           next. At the centre of the temple stands a quincunx of towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented 
           to the west; scholars are divided as to the significance of this. The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony 
           of the architecture, its extensive bas-reliefs, and for the numerous devatas adorning its walls. </article>

         <p>I love traveling, especially visiting old temples. I really want to go to this place to see the stone carvings on the Bayon Temple walls. I have heard so much about how 
             beautiful they are and that it holds so much histroy and facts. It will be nice to understand what and how people did things 
             at that period of time. They used different kinds of tools, boats, helmets, weapons and more. Can't believe the temple carvings 
             are so intricate, structure is synchronized, and so well aligned. There is architecture, agriculture, and irrigation system.
